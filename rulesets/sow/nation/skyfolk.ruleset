 Since then, they expanded into a mighty empire to rival all other
 nations. Many have been Chosen by Genesis to lead them, and their
 strength remains uncontested on the Skyworld. The Skyfolk are the 
 only medieval empire to possess an aerial division in their 
 military, giving them a huge advantage over their foes.
