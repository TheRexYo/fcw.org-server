; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first 
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Seafaring),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.

Leviathan is a beast spoken of only in legend.\
 It is said that this monster is nearly unkillable,\
 with the ability to create lightning storms of such\
 ferocity that even dragons are vulnerable. Its very\
 presence is enough to cause the oceans to rise, and\
 its body is so hot that its breath can light the sea\
 aflame. It is a beast that bows to no man, for only the\
 gods can control its anger.\
